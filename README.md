The project included gathering past stock price information for a specific stock; in this case, we will use Tesla Stocks Inc. The data was then pre-processed to ensure the quality of the data and to remove any outliers or noise that could affect the model's performance. After that, the pre-processed data was used to train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. LSTM is a Recurrent Neural Network that works on data sequences, learning to retain only relevant information from a time window. New information the network learns is added to a “memory” that gets updated with each timestep based on how significant the new sample seems to the model. In order to predict future stock prices, the LSTM model had to understand the patterns in the stock price data and trends in the historical stock price data. The model would have learned from past price movements and other relevant factors to make predictions about future stock prices. Several metrics, including mean absolute error and root mean square error, were used to assess the predictions. The outcomes demonstrated that the LSTM model was able to forecast future stock prices with accuracy. The assignment was finished as part of the project for a data science internship offered by Bharat Intern. The project's objective was to gain experience with using LSTM model in predicting stocks.
